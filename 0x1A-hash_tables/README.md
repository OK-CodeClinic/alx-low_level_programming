# C - Hash tables

### **General Knowledge**
**In this project, i started learning;**
1. What is a hash function
2. What makes a good hash function
3. What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
4. What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
5. What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
6. What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## General Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are allowed to use the C standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Test
We strongly encourage you to work all together on a set of tests

## Data Structures
These data structures were used for this project
```
/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
```

## Python Dictionaries
Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. When you will be done with this project, you will be able to better understand the power and simplicity of Python dictionaries. So much is actually happening when you type d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, but everything looks so simple for the user. Python doesn’t use the exact same implementation than the one you will work on today though. If you are curious on how it works under the hood, here is a good blog post about how dictionaries are implemented in Python 2.7 (not mandatory).

Note that all dictionaries are not implemented using hash tables and there is a difference between a dictionary and a hash table. Read more here (not mandatory).
## Tasks

#### **Mandatory Tasks*** 
**0. >>> ht = {}**
  * [0-hash_table_create.c](./0-hash_table_create.c): C function that creates a `hash_table_t`
  hash table.
    * If the function fails - returns `NULL`.
    * Otherwise - returns a pointer to the new hash table.

* **1. djb2**
  * [1-djb2.c](./1-djb2.c): C function that implements the djb2 hashing algorithm.

* **2. key -> index**
  * [2-key_index.c](./2-key_index.c): C function that returns the index at which a key/value
  pair should be stored in the array of a `hash_table_t` hash table.

* **3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'holberton'**
  * [3-hash_table_set.c](./3-hash_table_set.c): C function that adds an element to a
  `hash_table_t` table.
    * The parameter `key` cannot be an empty string.
    * Returns `1` on success, `0` otherwise.

* **4. >>> ht['betty']**
  * [4-hash_table_get.c](./4-hash_table_get.c): C function that retrieves a value associated
  with a key in a `hash_table_t` hash table.
    * If `key` cannot be matched - returns `NULL`.
    * Otherwise - returns the value associated with `key`.

* **5. >>> print(ht)**
  * [5-hash_table_print.c](./5-hash_table_print.c): C function that prints a `hash_table_t`
  hash table.
    * Prints each `key`/`value` pair in the order they appear in the array of the hash table.
    * Does not print anything if the hash table is `NULL`.

* **6. >>> del ht**
  * [6-hash_table_delete.c](./6-hasb_table_delete.c): C function that deletes a
  `hash_table_t` hash table.

### **Advanced Tasks**

* **7. $ht['Betty'] = 'BestSchool'**
  * [100-sorted_hash_table.c](./100-sorted_hash_table.c): C functions that define a sorted
  hash table `shash_table_t`.
    * Identical in function to a `hash_table_t` hash table except key/value
    pairs are inserted in alphabetical order according to the ASCII value of the key.
    * Key/value pairs are printed in the order they are sorted.
    * Includes a function `shash_table_print_rev()` that prints the hash table
    in reverse order.
